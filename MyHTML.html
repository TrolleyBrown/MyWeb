        <h1>Stray Birds</h1>
        <pre>
            Stray birds of summer come to my window to sing and fly away.
            And yellow leaves of autumn, which have no songs, flutter and
            fall there with a sigh.

            O troupe of little vagrants of the world, leave your footprints
            in my words.
